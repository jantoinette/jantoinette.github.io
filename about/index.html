      <h2>Hi, I'm Antoinette, a designer from Hong Kong based in NYC.</h2>
      <p>I've always liked words. I find it fascinating that humans have created these symbols and sounds and collectively agree on what they mean when put together, in order to exchange inner thoughts with one another. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics from the Unversity of Sydney, knowing that my true passion lies in the more abstract form of visual communication.</p>

      <p class="other-desc">üë©‚Äçüíª I like to think of myself as someone who writes with colors and paints with words.</p>
      <p>Design to me is very much an underdog in society. I'll save the debate on whether the <span><a href="https://readings.design/PDF/The%20Crystal%20Goblet.pdf" target="_blank">Crystal Goblet</a></span> should be <span><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/drowning-the-crystal-goblet.html" target="_blank">drowned</a></span> or not; but it's undeniable that design, especially good design is too often overlooked. I guess I pursue design as my own little revolution ‚Äì because I know its power in creating an impact and I want to be part of bringing positive change.</p>
      <p>It's helped me learn a lot about our world, but it's also been a way for me to learn a lot about myself. The <span><a href="../site/" target="_blank">Designer's Authority</a></span> workshop I did during my MPS at Parsons explains my design approach, which also shows how I usually approach problems. Design after all is creative solutions.</p>

      <p class="other-desc">ü§ì "Etudiant" is the gerund form of "to study" in French, and an allophone of √©tudiant meaning ‚Äústudent‚Äù.</p>
      <p>That's what I named the first <span><a href="../work/etudiant/">typeface I designed</a></span>. I guess the whole thing about a typeface design being "never finished" reminded me that everytime I work on anything, it is an opportunity to learn; how I took this type design course because I like learning; and how I want to always be learning new things. I've always thought that maybe one day when I retire I'd do a bachelors in psychology.</p>
