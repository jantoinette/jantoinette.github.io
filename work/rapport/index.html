          <h5>Challenge</h5>
          <p class="desc">The healthcare industry is often associated with complex, difficult-to-navigate systems. Technology solutions in this space can be perceived as either too clinical and impersonal or too complicated for everyday use. The primary challenge for Rapport AI Medical was to create a brand that felt approachable yet authoritative, innovative yet human. They needed to convey their technological expertise and trustworthiness while ensuring that their platform felt accessible to medical professionals and patients alike.</p>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p class="desc">By focusing on the intersection of care, confidence, and simplicity, the new brand system helped to position the platform as an approachable yet powerful tool in the healthcare space. Looking ahead, the brand will continue to evolve as the business expands its offerings, but the core values of intellectual caregiving, smart simplicity, and soft confidence will remain at the heart of Rapport's identity.</p>

          <h5>Logo Design</h5>
          <p class="desc">We created a soft, modern design with clean lines to reflect simplicity and sophistication. The abstract, fluid icon subtly alludes to the relationship between AI and healthcare, while the bold typeface conveys confidence and professionalism.</p>
          <h5>Color Palette</h5>
          <p class="desc">We opted for a calming color palette of soft blues and greens to convey trust, peace, and reliability, balanced with accents of brighter colors like coral to inject warmth and energy. This color scheme aligned with the notion of caregiving, evoking feelings of comfort and trust.</p>
