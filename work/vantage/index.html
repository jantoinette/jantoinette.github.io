          <h5>Challenge</h5>
          <p class="desc">Vantage, a leading multi-asset broker, operates in the highly competitive world of online trading, catering to clients who trade a wide range of financial instruments, including forex, stocks, and commodities. As competition in online CFD trading intensifies and customer expectations evolve, Vantage recognized the need to reposition its brand and modernize its digital presence to attract both experienced traders and a new generation of investors.</p>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p class="desc">By immersing in stakeholder interviews, 360-degree competitor audit, as well as AI-driven customer research, we obtained a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of Vantage, including its ambition to its capabilities, competitors and target customers. With these insights, we defined the new brand positioning as to “provide a trusted trading ecosystem that enables customers to achieve their own success, faster and simpler”.</p>

          <h5>Visual Identity System</h5>
          <p class="desc">Building upon the concept of “Shared Success”, we applied the Fibonacci Golden Ratio in creating Vantage’s new visual identity system. The Fibonacci Golden Ratio is not only permeated in nature and art but also prevalent in financial markets – Fibonacci retracement levels are often key indicators to predict market movements. The idea resonates with the brand category and strategy to resemble precision, growth patterns, perfect harmony and concise prediction of patterns in an ecosystem. To help Vantage envision its new visual identity, we created customized iconography, brand and photography guidelines, as well as a wide range of applications including website and mobile app re-skin.</p>

          <h5>Results</h5>
          <p class="desc">Vantage's new brand was well-received by industry peers at its launch in November 2021. The group achieved a significant increase of nearly 30% in new users in three months, compared to the same period before the rebrand. Vantage was also recognized at the 2021 Transform Awards Asia, for the categories of ‘Best brand development project to reflect the changed mission, values or positioning’ and the ‘Best visual identity from the financial services sector’.</p>
